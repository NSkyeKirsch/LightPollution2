      <p id="stuff">Light pollution can play a role in the destruction of natural habitats and harm the populations of animals across the globe.</p>
      <p id="stuff">For example, it is believed that newborn sea turtles find the ocean by looking for the reflections off the water. However, light from cities can confuse the turtles and lead them the wrong way. This makes them extremely vulnerable to predators and other dangers.</p>
      <p id="stuff">Another example is with birds. Like to sea turtles, birds can use light as a guide, especially during long migrations. Light from inside buildings at night can lead birds to smash into windows. Even if the impact does not end them immediately, falling from high in the sky or predators on the ground could do it instead.</p>
